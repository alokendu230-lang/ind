   </table> </h1><br> <br>
<h2> 2.Port Number <br>
   A port number helps your computer identify which app or service should handle the data coming in or going out.</p>
<br>
Example:
<ul>
<br>
<li>We browsing uses Port 80 (HTTP).</li>
<br>
<li>
Secure websites use Port 443 (HTTPS).</li>

</ul>

2.Works with IP Address <br>

The IP address finds the device, and the port number finds the specific service or app on that device.
<br>
Example:
<ul>
<li>Your house address = IP address</li>

<li>Room number = Port number</li></ul>
<br> 


3. 16-Bit Number <br>

Port numbers are 16 bits long, which means they are stored using 16 ones and zeros in computer language.
<br> <br>
4. Unsigned Number
<br>
“Unsigned” means no negative numbers are allowed — only positive numbers.
<br>
<br>
5. Range of Port Numbers<br>

Since it’s 16-bit, there are 65,536 possible ports, numbered from 0 to 65,535.
<br><br>


6. Common Port Numbers,<br>

Some ports are reserved for popular services, like:
<br><ul>
<li>80 → HTTP (Websites)</li>
<li>443 → HTTPS (Secure websites)</li>
<li>
25 → Email (SMTP)</li>
<li>
21 → FTP (File Transfer)</li>



<h2>The Practical Format: The Three Categories</h2>

To prevent chaos, the internet authorities (IANA) have divided the 65,536 available ports into three categories. This is the most practical format for you as a developer to understand.
<h2><table border="2">
    <tr>
        <td>Well-Known Ports (0 - 1023)
<br><br></td>
    </tr>
   </table> </h2>


<br><br>
1.Reserved Ports: Used for important and common internet services.
<br>

2.Managed By IANA: Strictly controlled to keep them secure.
<br>

3.Admin Access Needed: You need admin or root permission to use these ports.
<br>
Examples:

<li>21 → FTP (File Transfer)</li>
<li>22 → SSH (Secure Login)</li>
<li>25 → SMTP (Send Email)</li>

<li>53 → DNS (Domain Name System)</li>
<li>80 → HTTP (Web Traffic)</li>
<li>443 → HTTPS (Secure Web Traffic)</li>

<h2><table border="2">
    <tr>
        <td>Registered Ports (1024 - 49151)
<br><br></td>
    </tr>
   </table> </h2>

1.Purpose: Used by specific apps or services that are not as universal as well-known ports.
<br>
2.Registration: Developers can register a port with IANA to avoid conflicts.
<br>
3.No Admin Needed: You don’t need admin permissions to run apps on these ports.
<br>
Examples (For MERN Developers):

<li>3000 → React / Node.js development servers</li>

<li>3306 → MySQL database</li>

<li>5432 → PostgreSQL database</li>

<li>27017 → MongoDB database (default for MERN stack)
</li>
<li>8080 → Alternative web server port for testing
</li>

<h2><table border="2">
    <tr>
        <td>Dynamic / Private / Ephemeral Ports (49152 - 65535)
<br><br></td>
    </tr>
   </table> </h2>




1.Temporary Use: These ports are used only for short-term connections.
<br>

2.No Control: Not managed by IANA — anyone can use them.
<br>
3Used by Clients: When your browser or app connects to a server, your computer automatically picks a random port from this range.
<br>
4. Example:  
<br>
<br>
<li>You visit google.com on port 443 (HTTPS).
</li>
<li>Your computer might use port 50231 as its temporary source port.
</li>
<br>

5.Key Rule:
<br>
Servers never listen on these ports — they are for client-side communication only.

</ul>
