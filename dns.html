<h2>DNS is the global, distributed system that translates the human-friendly domain names into the computer-friendly IP addresses. Without it, you'd have to memorize hundreds of IP addresses to browse the web.</h2>

<h2>
Step 1: Checking the Local Cache <br>

Before doing extra work, your computer first checks if it already knows the website's IP address to save time. It checks in this order:
<br> <br>
1.Browser Cache: Recently visited websites saved in your browser.
<br>
2.OS Cache: Stored by your computer’s operating system.
<br>
3.Router Cache: Sometimes saved in your Wi-Fi router.
<br>

If found here: Your browser connects immediately, making the website load much faster.</h2>

<h2>
Step 2: The Recursive Resolver
<br>
If the IP address isn’t in any local cache, your computer asks a Recursive DNS Resolver for help.
<ol>
<li>Who It Is:</li>
<ul><li>Usually provided by your ISP.</li>
    <li>Or you can use public ones like Google (8.8.8.8) or Cloudflare (1.1.1.1).
</li>
</ul>


<li>Why "Recursive":</li>
<ul>
    <li>It does all the work to find the correct IP.</li>
    <li>
It searches step-by-step through the DNS system until it gets the final answer</li>
</ul>
</ul>
</ol>

Step 3: The Hierarchical Search (Global Phonebook)
<br>

The Recursive Resolver searches step-by-step through the DNS system to find the website’s IP:
<ol>
<li>Root Servers
<ul>
    <li>First stop: The resolver asks, “Where can I find .com domains?”
</li>
    <li>Root server replies with TLD server info.
</li>
</ul>


 
<li>TLD Servers:</li><ul>
<li>Next, it asks, “Where can I find google.com?”</li>
<li>TLD server replies with Google’s authoritative server info.</li>
 </ul>




<li>Authoritative Server:</li> <ul>
<li>Finally, it asks, “What is the IP for www.google.com?”</li>

<li>Server replies: 142.250.72.206 (Google’s IP).
</li></ul>

</ol>



Step 4: The Journey Back
<ol>
<li>Authoritative Server → Resolver: Sends the correct IP to the Recursive Resolver.</li>
<li>Resolver Caches It: Stores the IP for a while (TTL) to answer future requests quickly.</li>
<li>Resolver → Computer: Sends the IP to your computer’s operating system.
</li>

<li>Computer → Browser: Your OS gives the IP to the browser, so it can connect to the website.
</li>
</ol>

Step 5: The Final Connection

<ol>
    <li>Your browser now has the IP address (e.g., 142.250.72.206).</li>
    <li>It connects to the server on port 443 (HTTPS).</li>
    <li>The browser asks “Please send me the webpage for www.google.com.”</li>
    <li>The DNS process is done and the website starts loading. </li>
</ol>

The DNS process is complete.
